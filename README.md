You can run the code by downloading it from GitHub. I have created a separate branch called project for that purpose.

The homepage is the same as the exercise materials, with only Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok logos added. For the project, navigation has been added between Home, About Us, Blog, and Login pages. The About Us page uses parallax and grid, the Blog page uses a slideshow, and the Login page uses flexbox. All pages are responsive in mobile view.
